# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the famous **Iris dataset** to classify flowers into three species:  
- *Iris-setosa*  
- *Iris-versicolor*  
- *Iris-virginica*  

It demonstrates **data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning models** using Python.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Checked for null values (none found ✅)  
- Visualized distributions of features with histograms & countplots  
- Correlation analysis showed strong relation between **petal length & petal width**
